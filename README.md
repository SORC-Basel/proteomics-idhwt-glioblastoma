# Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of IDH-Wildtype Glioblastoma

This repository contains the complete analytical workflow and source code for a quantitative proteomics study of gliomas, with a focus on identifying distinct functional subtypes within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The project utilizes LC-MS-based proteomic profiling and bioinformatic analysis to uncover molecular differences across glioblastoma subgroups.

The repository supports the findings presented in the study:

## ðŸ§  Study Overview

**Purpose**  
To investigate the proteomic landscape of gliomas and identify functional subtypes within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma that may inform our understanding of tumor biology and suggest potential therapeutic targets.

**Key Findings**
- A total of 82 glioma biopsies were analyzed across six methylomic-defined subgroups (two low-grade gliomas [LGG], and four high-grade gliomas [HGG]).
- LC-MS-based proteomic profiling quantified 5,057 proteins per sample.
- Tumor grade and IDH mutation status were the dominant features discriminating expression profiles.
- Among IDH-wildtype glioblastoma subtypes, distinct patterns of overexpressed proteins were identified:
  - **Proneural subtype:** Enriched for proteins involved in translation and telomere/cell cycle regulation (linked to proliferation).
  - **Classical subtype:** Enriched for cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and apoptosis regulation (linked to invasion/migration).
  - **Mesenchymal subtype:** Characterized by mitochondrial ATP synthesis and metabolic signatures.
- Overexpressed proteins were correlated with mRNA expression (TCGA) and patient survival.
- Functional validation using inhibitor assays in patient-derived single-cell glioblastoma cultures demonstrated subgroup-specific sensitivity.
